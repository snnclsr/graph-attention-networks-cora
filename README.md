This is the accompanying code for [this](https://snnclsr.github.io/2021/03/21/graph-neural-networks/) blog post. The code is adopted from [this](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric/blob/master/examples/gat.py) code (from PyTorch Geometric Library) which applies the Graph Attention Networks to the Cora Dataset.

Here is the general overview of the blog post. 

* A Brief Introduction to Graphs
* Machine Learning on graphs
    * Node Classification/Regression
    * Link Prediction
    * Community Detection & Clustering
    * Graph Classification/Regression
* Graph Neural Networks (Formulation)
* Neural Message Passing
